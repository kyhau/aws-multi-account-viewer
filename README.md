Notes:
- This repo is forked from [awslabs/aws-multi-account-viewer](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-multi-account-viewer).
- See [Release Notes](ReleaseNotes.md) for the changes and addition features.

---
Serverless app designed for any customer with two or more accounts to view resources across accounts/regions in simple single pane of glass website. It's split into 2 customizable parts:

- Back-End (CloudFormation templates and Python Lambdas)
- Front-End (CloudFormation templates and React with Amplify)

Current working examples are:

- All AWS Accounts in Organizations
- All EC2, Lambdas, ODCR, EC2 Reserved Instances, RDS, EKS, Lightsail
- All IAM Users, Roles, Policy’s
- All VPCs, Subnets
- All S3 Buckets
- All Private and Public IP's
- All Tags

## Architecture

![Architecture](images/AWS-Multi-Account-Overview.png)

## Requirements

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 8.10+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- At least 2 AWS accounts.

## Install Overview

Administrator account is the account you will use to access all sub accounts and where you will store everything.
SubAccounts only requires the SubAccountAccess template to be created.

- Clone repo.
- Run CloudFormation template in your sub accounts (SubAccountAccess.yaml).
- Run CloudFormation template in your main account (MainTemplate.yaml).
- Run React App.

## Deploying the Solution

#### Sub Accounts

- Note the Account number for your Administrator Account and put it into the SubAccountAccess template.
- Edit the __SubAccountAccess.yaml__ with your Administrator Account Number (this account number will be your Administrator account that will have access to view all the sub accounts from)
![](images/sub-account.png)
- Save and Run the __SubAccountAccess.yaml__ in all your sub accounts you want to view. (I recommend using [StackSets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html) if you have them enabled otherwise manual is fine)

#### Administrator Account

- Create a new S3 bucket to store the lambda zip files

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://your-unique-bucket-name --region ap-southeast-2
```
- Package up all the lambdas into one zip file (e.g __functions.zip__): see example below or doco [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html) 

- The only external python modules: boto3

```bash
cd /aws-multi-account-viewer/Back-End/lambdas
python3.7 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
cd build
pip install -r ../requirements.txt --target .
zip -r9 ../functions.zip .
cd ../
zip -g functions.zip list_table.py receive_sqs_message.py send_sqs_message.py
deactivate
```

- Copy the functions.zip file you just packaged into the s3 bucket you created earlier.

```bash
aws s3 cp functions.zip s3://your-unique-bucket-name
```

#### CloudFormation Parameters

Everyone's accounts and regions vary so this example is set to the free tier for DynamoDB
AutoScaling is configured for DynamoDB so it will between the 2 parameters you specifiy.

- Update all the parameters to match your config/accounts/bucket in MainTemplate.yaml
- Deploy the CloudFormation template in the admin account once you have updated the paramaters
- Once the CloudFormation has completed copy the details in the outputs:
    - __ApiGateWayEndPoint__
    - __UserPoolId__
    - __userPoolWebClientId__

![](images/cloudformation-outputs.png)

- Paste the outputs into /aws-multi-account-viewer/Front-End/src/App.js

![](images/cognito.png)

- Create a user account for the Cognito User Pool (sign up is disabled, so users have to be created manually)
- Cognito > User Pools > {YourStackName} > Users and groups > Create User.
- Now navigate to Front-End and Install dependencies

```bash
cd /aws-multi-account-viewer/Front-End/
yarn
```
![](images/yarn-2.png)

- Start React Page

```bash
yarn start
```
![](images/yarn.png)

- You should now see a login page from React

![](images/login-complete.png)

- Log in with the user you created earlier.
- You now have a local version up and running, you could now safely host as a public s3 bucket. 
(not covered in this project but you can see examples online on how to set it up: [S3-Public-Website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html))
- A really good article on setting React up with S3 by Antoine Sauvage: [Here](https://medium.com/ovrsea/deploy-automatically-a-react-app-on-amazon-s3-iam-within-minutes-da6cb0096d55)


## Adding New Services

To add a new services, see example for this git commit:

- Example of adding a new service EKS here [EKS](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-multi-account-viewer/pull/10/files)


## Troubleshooting

### No data is being populated on the web site?

- Check SQS to make sure the messages are going through to lambda
- If there’s lots of messages in the queue then there’s an issue with the lambda or DynamoDB is throttling the requests.

### Site breaks when hosted on s3?

- There's a good guide above on how to host React on S3, most common gotcha is error document:
![](images/s3-sample.png)

### Lambda Logs Overview?

- You can check all three lambdas logs easy in CloudWatch Insights:
![](images/sample-insights.png)

### Lambda Logs Error & Exceptions:

Copy and paste query below to only see Errors & Exceptions:
(this example is showing throttle requests on DynamoDB because its set too low):

```bash
fields @message 
| filter @message like /Error/ or @message like /Exception/
| limit 50
```
![](images/sample-exception.png)

### Tables are empty?
- Check SQS queue to see what services are failing
- View CloudWatch Logs above across receive/send lambda's to see where the issue is.
